# Toastycoin Frontier

Toastycoin Frontier is a client-side interface for creating, browsing, and interacting with Burnable Payments (BPs), a specific kind of Ethereum smart contract (see BurnableOpenPayment.sol).

Later on in development, the project could be expanded to interact with other contract types.

# Usage

Simply navigate to www.toastycoin.com or https://cryptoprimitive.github.io/toastycoin-frontier if you have Metamask or another web3 provider.

## Installation
If you'd like to run the Toastycoin Frontier code locally, run a (local) webserver and ensure you have access to an Ethereum node, then download and unzip or clone the repository files into a directory accessible to the webserver.
```
git clone https://github.com/cryptoprimitive/toastycoin-frontier
```

Toastycoin Beta is Toastycoin Frontier's predecessor; Gianluca is responsible for overcoming many middle- and late-stage development challenges for the Toastycoin interface.
