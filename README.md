# Toastycoin

Toastycoin is a client-side interface for creating, browsing, and interacting with Burnable Payments (BPs), a specific kind of Ethereum smart contract (see BurnableOpenPayment.sol).

Later on in development, the project could be expanded to interact with other contract types.

## Installation
The only software required for Toastycoin to run is a (local) webserver and access to an ethereum node. The easiest way to achieve this is to install the [metamask plugin](https://metamask.io/).

Download and unzip or clone the repository files into a directory on a webserver.
```
git clone https://github.com/coinop-logan/coinop-logan.github.io
```

See also the alternative interface, "Toastycoin G". https://github.com/gianlucaschoefer/gianlucaschoefer.github.com

Toastycoin G is Toastycoin's predecessor, and Gianluca is responsible for overcoming many middle- and late-stage development challenges for the Toastycoin interface.
